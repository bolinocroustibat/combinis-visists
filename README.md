Counts the number of unique combinis visited using Google Maps Location History data.


## How to

You need to have your [Google Maps Location History turned on](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3118687) for the past period you've been visiting conbinis.

Since there is no Google Maps Location History API, you need to first download your data.
Download your Google Location History data using [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout), unzip and copy in this project folder.

Execute the attached Jupiter Notebook according to the notebook notes.
